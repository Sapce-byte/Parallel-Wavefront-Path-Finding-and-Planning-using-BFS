# Parallel-Wavefront-Path-Finding-and-Planning-using-BFS
This project aims to improve the performance of the BFS wavefront pathfinding algorithm using OpenMP parallelization. By distributing computations across multiple threads, it reduces execution time on large mazes while analyzing scalability, synchronization overhead, and efficiency compared to the sequential approach.
